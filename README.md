## An Enhanced Earthquake Early Warning System

Earthquakes can cause tremendous destruction, making effective early warning systems essential. This project introduces a deep learning-based regional earthquake early warning (EEW) system that leverages multi-station data to improve both accuracy and lead time.

### Key Contributions:
- Development of a deep learning-based model that integrates data from multiple stations for more accurate regional warnings.
- Inclusion of historical statistics and background knowledge to enhance prediction robustness.
- A flexible transformer-based architecture, designed for scalability and adaptation to various datasets and regions.

By utilizing Taiwanâ€™s seismic data, our model demonstrated a significant improvement over traditional onsite methods, offering an average lead time extension of more than 2 seconds.
