## An Enhanced Earthquake Early Warning System

This project is based on the work presented in the abstract submitted to the Japan Geoscience Union (JpGU) 2024. The abstract is currently under review and has not yet been published on their official website.

### Abstract
Earthquakes can cause tremendous destruction, making effective early warning systems essential. This project introduces a deep learning-based regional earthquake early warning (EEW) system that leverages multi-station data to improve both accuracy and lead time.

### Key Contributions:
- Development of a deep learning-based model that integrates data from multiple stations for more accurate regional warnings.
- Inclusion of historical statistics and background knowledge to enhance prediction robustness.
- A flexible transformer-based architecture, designed for scalability and adaptation to various datasets and regions.

By utilizing Taiwanâ€™s seismic data, our model demonstrated a significant improvement over traditional onsite methods, offering an average lead time extension of more than 2 seconds.
